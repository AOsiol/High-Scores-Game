# High-Scores-Game
Game Outline

This is a game designed to interact with the player with a start button, timer, questions to answer by clicking buttons, and a button to show high scores. 

This project presented a challenge to me. I created pseudo-code for planning the interactive elements. After writting the code for the different elements, trying a few different approaches without success, I would delete portions and start over. I inserted a few things that Justin Slacked out, but that was not necessarily how I think about the approach, so I backed off and am trying different options.
